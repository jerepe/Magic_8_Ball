# Magic 8-Ball

### What does it do ?
> Reads your future (not really).

### Why ?
> Codecademy project, that i adapted to my needs. Meaning they didn't ask to read user input, but i found that cool to play with, so i added it.
> Tougher than anything previously done to figure out the proper workflow.
> Could sound fishy to some, but i'm really happy it was, because i learned a lot.
> Visualisation is very important in programming, working it through algorithms creation is truly rewardeable over the long-term
> I don't have any long-term experience, but means i 100% bet on that :)

### How should i use it ?
> Enter your name, your question.
> If you don't enter your name, it will simply output your question, and give your an answer
> If you enter your name, but no question, no answer will be given :(
> If you enter neither one of them, no answer will be given too ...
